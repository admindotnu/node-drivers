- [ ] fix EPath capitalized folder name issue
- [ ] Move EIP under cip
- Logix5000
  - [ ] Figure out how to read multidimensional arrays (CIP Vol 1, Table C-5.20)
  - [ ] Optimize
    - [ ] persist processor information to file system
    - [ ] readTags/bulkReadTags, multiple service packet
- CIP
  - [ ] allow Skipping EIP layer if lowerlayer is TCP
  - [ ] Add engineering unit codes
  - [ ] Connection handle duplicate connection
  - [ ] understand the difference between direct requests, Connection Manager Unconnected Send messages, Connected messages, and how routes to eni/controller
  - [ ] use UCMM to get identity and verify device type is programmable logic controller OR fix path routing
  - [ ] Only send packets up to the packet rate
  - [ ] Consider making CIPLayer intelligent, uses upper layer to determine if it is forwarding PCCC, Modbus, etc.
  - [ ] Add I/O Connections
  - [ ] Connection object read attributes (attribute 2 is instance type)
  - [ ] Read CIP Vol 1 Chapter 10 regarding briding and routing
  - [ ] Allow explicit unconnected sends even with connection
  - [ ] add encoding for STRINGI, STRINGN, BOOL
- TCP Layer
  - [ ] create TLS layer or just use options.tls?
- PCCC
  - [ ] Add fragramentation
  - [ ] Add processor specific layers (SLC/PLC2/PLC5)
  - [ ] Word range read request must be an even number of bytes??
  - [ ] Abstract word range read request where total bytes to read is greater than 228
- Modbus
  - [ ] improve readHoldingRegisters address/number support
    - [ ] addressing using string, '40001' or '400001'
    - [ ] addressing using string with data type '40001S'
    - [ ] Data types
      - [ ] Boolean (1-bit with position)
      - [ ] Word (unsigned 16-bit)
      - [ ] Short (signed 16-bit)
      - [ ] DWord (unsigned 32-bit)
      - [ ] Long (signed 32-bit)
